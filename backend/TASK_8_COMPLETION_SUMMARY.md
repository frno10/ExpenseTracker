  - Multi-criteria search (date range, amount range, keywords)
  - Optimized queries with proper indexing
  - User-scoped searches for security

### 5. API Endpoints ✅

- **Upload Endpoint**: `POST /api/statement-import/upload`
  - File validation and temporary storage
  - Parser detection and format verification
  - Returns upload ID for workflow tracking

- **Preview Endpoint**: `POST /api/statement-import/preview/{upload_id}`
  - Parses uploaded file and returns sample transactions
  - Shows parsing errors and warnings
  - Provides metadata about the parsing process

- **Confirm Import**: `POST /api/statement-import/confirm/{upload_id}`
  - Executes the actual import with user selections
  - Applies custom mappings and duplicate detection
  - Returns detailed import results

- **Import History**: `GET /api/statement-import/history`
  - Lists user's import history with pagination
  - Shows status and metadata for each import

- **Delete Upload**: `DELETE /api/statement-import/upload/{upload_id}`
  - Cleans up temporary files and data

### 6. Comprehensive Testing ✅

- **Location**: `backend/test_statement_import_simple.py`
- **Test Coverage**:
  - File validation logic (size limits, format detection)
  - Duplicate detection algorithms (text similarity, transaction scoring)
  - Import workflow orchestration (upload → parse → import)
  - File format detection for all supported types
  - Error handling and edge cases

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Duplicate Detection

```python
# Similarity scoring algorithm
def calculate_similarity_score(transaction1, transaction2):
    # Amount similarity (40% weight)
    # Date similarity (30% weight) 
    # Description similarity (30% weight)
    return weighted_score  # 0.0 to 1.0
```

### Multi-Step Import Workflow

1. **Upload**: File validation and temporary storage
2. **Parse**: Statement parsing with error handling
3. **Review**: User reviews transactions and resolves conflicts
4. **Import**: Selective import with duplicate detection

### Intelligent Parser Integration

- Automatic format detection using file extensions and MIME types
- Integration with existing 5-parser system (CSV, PDF, Excel, OFX, QIF)
- Fallback parser selection if primary detection fails
- Comprehensive error reporting and recovery

### Security & Performance

- User isolation across all operations
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Temporary file cleanup
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Memory-efficient processing for large files
