## 🚀 Key Monitoring Achievements

### Enterprise-Grade Health Monitoring
```python
# Comprehensive health check system
health_status = await health_checker.get_overall_health()
# Returns: {
#   "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
#   "uptime_seconds": 3600,
#   "average_response_time_ms": 45.2,
#   "checks": {
#     "database": {"status": "healthy", "response_time_ms": 12.5},
#     "redis": {"status": "healthy", "response_time_ms": 8.3},
#     "disk_space": {"status": "healthy", "free_percent": 65.2}
#   }
# }
```

### Real-Time Business Metrics
```python
# Business metrics tracking
metrics_collector.increment_counter("expenses_created_total", 1)
metrics_collector.set_gauge("active_users", 150)
metrics_collector.record_histogram("api_response_time", 245.7)

# Dashboard metrics
dashboard_data = await metrics_collector.get_dashboard_metrics()
# Returns: {
#   "system": {"active_users": 150, "memory_usage_mb": 512},
#   "business": {"expenses_created_today": 45, "parser_success_rate": 94.2},
#   "performance": {"response_time_p95": 245.7, "error_rate": 0.8}
# }
```

### Smart Alerting with Multiple Channels
```python
# Intelligent alert rules
AlertRule(
    name="high_memory_usage",
    description="Memory usage is critically high",
    metric_name="memory_usage",
    condition=">",
    threshold=0.9,  # 90%
    severity=AlertSeverity.CRITICAL,
    duration=timedelta(minutes=2),  # Must persist for 2 minutes
    cooldown=timedelta(minutes=30)  # 30-minute cooldown
)

# Multiple notification channels
alert_manager.add_notification_channel(email_notification_channel)
alert_manager.add_notification_channel(slack_notification_channel)
alert_manager.add_notification_channel(webhook_notification_channel)
```

### Production-Ready Monitoring API
